Organizers and convenors of community events carry heightened ethical responsibilities, especially as NLP systems move into production and everyday use. They must set and enforce clear standards for submissions and presentations, including requirements on data provenance and consent, privacy protections, bias and fairness assessment, safety and red‑teaming, environmental impact reporting, and disclosure of funding, conflicts of interest, and potential dual‑use risks. 

They should ensure accessibility and inclusion, provide channels for community feedback and harm reporting, and require authors to articulate real‑world impacts, mitigation plans, and limits of generalization. By embedding ethics into calls for papers, reviewing rubrics, speaker guidelines, and on‑site practices, organizers shape a culture of accountability that protects participants, affected communities, and the broader public.

Below, we outline considerations for **prospective organizers** planning workshops or conferences, followed by timelines and logistics for **organizers** executing the event.

# Prospective Organizers 

## 1. Ensure Appropriate Gender, Geographic and Cultural balance

* Scientific events often feature plenary talks and panels where speakers are seen as representing the community or stakeholder perspectives. Aim for balanced representation, especially in plenaries and keynotes across multiple days.
* Panels should include diverse and, where appropriate, opposing viewpoints to enrich discussion.
Budget extra time and resources to identify, invite, and support underrepresented voices (e.g., travel support, remote participation options, childcare). Appoint a *Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion* (DEI) chair to coordinate with sponsorship leads to enable these accommodations.

## 2. Reserve Sufficient Time for Ethical Review
* Ethical and scientific reviews should be given comparable attention and time. Ensure your reviewing timeline explicitly includes adequate time for ethics review, not just technical evaluation.
* See [Recommendations for Conference Chairs](../resources/ethical-review-recommendations/index.md#2-recommendations-for-conference-chairs) has a full rundown of the timeline; review it even before submitting your proposal. 
* Engage us as the current [ACL Ethics Committee](../committee.md) early to help seed your ethics reviewer pool and to advise on review criteria and triage processes.

## 3. Signal that ethics is a first-order priority
* Event webpages and calls for papers (CFPs) should clearly communicate ethical expectations and review policies. Include explicit ethics sections in CFPs, submission checklists, and reviewer guidelines.
* Publicly list the officers responsible for ethics (e.g., Ethics Chair, DEI Chair) and provide a contact channel for concerns, harm reports, and requests for guidance.
* Reinforce ethical commitments in author instructions, speaker agreements, and session moderation guidelines, and highlight them during opening remarks and author briefings.

# Organizers

## 1. Form a Diverse Ethics Committee

* Build a large and diverse ethics committee with people from different countries and continents with different genders. Members should know about different areas like fairness, privacy, environmental impact, worker welfare, and specific uses (like healthcare or law). Use term limits so new reviewers can join and avoid having the same people review every time. See the [NAACL 2021 committee](https://2021.naacl.org/ethics/committee/) as an example.
* Assign papers to reviewers from different countries than the authors to reduce pressure from governments or institutions. Pair new ethics reviewers with experienced ones for guidance and to improve quality.

## 2. Plan Enough Time and Manage Reviews
* Post the ethics committee information and author guidelines **at least one month before** submissions open on the conference website and email lists. Give at least 2-3 weeks for ethics review in your timeline, with a clear deadline for when papers can be flagged. The full process, including helping authors fix issues in conditionally accepted papers, takes a long time and needs careful planning.
* Set up clear steps for checking flagged papers, since some will not actually need full ethics review. Use tracking tools (like spreadsheets) to assign reviewers, watch ongoing reviews, and remind reviewers before deadlines. Make sure ethics chairs can access and use your conference platform (OpenReview, SoftConf). See [ethics review logistics](../resources/ethical-review-recommendations/index.md#ethics-review-logistics) for detailed steps.

## 3. Define Scope and Document the Process
* Make it clear that ethics chairs only review ethical issues in how the research was done, not the scientific quality or future uses beyond what authors discuss. State this clearly in reviewer guidelines and make sure the Responsible NLP checklist asks authors to confirm they had legal permission to use their data.
* Write down details about the process using the [ACL ethics committee's documentation form](https://ethics.aclweb.org/), including how many papers were flagged for ethics review, actually reviewed, accepted with conditions, and rejected for ethical reasons. This helps future chairs plan their work and improves the process over time.

## 4. Add Ethics to Calls for Papers and Policies
* Include ethics guidelines clearly in all Calls for Papers (CFPs) and state that papers can be rejected for ethical problems. This early warning may stop people from submitting papers with clear ethical issues, like using workers without mentioning fair pay.
* Use the same ethical rules for all conference tracks (main, student, industrial) and for Calls for Tutorials and Workshop Proposals. Workshop papers go into the ACL Anthology, so they must follow the same ethical rules as other papers. See [Call for Papers suggestions](../resources/ethical-review-recommendations/index.md#suggestions-for-call-for-paper) for more details.
