What are you looking for? Ethics is a broad and interdisciplinary concern of our field. </p> <p>Ethics can be defined as \"a branch of philosophy that systematizes, defends, and recommends concepts of right and wrong conduct\" (Wikipedia). As members of the ACL community, ethics can guide us towards a fairer, more respectful and honest research, which aims at honoring everyone, within and outside of our community, as well as our environment. You will find a more detailed definition in the ACL Code of Ethics, with a special focus on ethics as a NLP researcher.</p> <p>The people visiting this website have one or several of the questions below in mind that brought them here. Which one is/are yours? </p> <p>Starting your Research? One aspect of ethical research is not only to adhere to the Ethics Charter linked above, but also to think about our research methodology as outlined in the responsible research checklist. This checklist should be part of every scientific project in the domain of CL/NLP and should be the first point of reference if you come up with an interesting research question \u2013 even before you start working on it. Throughout the project, the checklist guides you to keep in mind questions of responsible research. Added benefit: On submission of your paper it is already filled in and you don\u2019t have to think about what you decided several weeks or months ago. See here how this can be put into practice. </p> <p>How do I review for Ethics?  Much of our research can have real-world implications and touch on sensitive ethical issues. As a concerned scholar and reviewer of our community, perhaps you are unsure what constitutes an appropriate use for flagging a paper for further ethics review.  Perhaps you also want to learn how to contribute to the process of assessing papers for ethical issues. We\u2019ll show you how to best use the author-provided responsible research checklist as a basis for starting your assessment, and also how to test your own knowledge of ethics through case studies and simulated reviewing.</p> <p>Ethics reviewing is arguably one of the most important contributions we as a community can do for the long-term health of our field. Right now, we are sorely lacking in enough manpower to do all the reviewing we would ideally want to do. By completing these self-guided exercises, we hope that you will volunteer to the pool of qualified ethical reviewers to help make scalable ethics reviewing a reality. You can find case studies in the Tutorial resources, and a detailed recommendations document in the Resource section.</p> <p>How do I learn about Ethical Concerns? While checklists are a good means to start thinking about ethics from common perspectives, it is important to view such checklists as an incomplete means to holistically think about the impact of our work. There will be new areas of concern that become necessary to consider as our scholarship continues to advance. We\u2019ll walk you through some case studies to help you think about works from multiple stakeholders\u2019 perspectives and timeframes. You can find such case studies in the Tutorial resources.</p> <p>Are there good resources to teach Ethics? You are a researcher, lecturer, reader or professor in CL/NLP and want to raise awareness on ethical issues amongst your students \u2013 either BSc, MSc or PhD level. Our Instructors page organizes the resources relevant to teaching ethics to students.</p> <p>I am interested in Ethics Research, where should I start? We compiled a list of relevant NLP papers that address a variety of topics: biases,  crowdsourcing issues, dual use, environmental impact,... You can find this Reading list, and contribute to it, in the Resource section.</p>"},{"location":"committee/","title":"Committee","text":""},{"location":"committee/#members-of-the-acl-ethics-committee","title":"Members of the ACL Ethics Committee","text":"David Ifeoluwa Adelani (david.adelani@mcgill.ca, he/him) is an Assistant Professor at McGill School of Computer Science, Canada and a Core Academic Member at MILA, and a Canada CIFAR AI Chair (in 2024).

They are not just a formality; they are critical to the integrity of academic discourse. In particular, the ethics reviews are meant to assess whether the submitted research exhibits any substantial ethical issues and could lead to harm. It is especially critical to uphold these standards as we engage in research that deals with sensitive data and/or controversial topics. Ethics reviewing plays a pivotal role in safeguarding these standards. We want to emphasize that an ethics review is not just about ticking boxes, nor is it a technical review; it\u2019s about engaging critically with the material and its implications.</p> <p>The existence of ethics committees should not inhibit, prevent, or discourage reviewers, ACs, or SACs from making decisions to reject a paper on the basis of ethical concerns.

The number of submissions keeps increasing every year, and we must ensure that all papers adhere to ethical standards, rules, and regulations. Reviewers and action editors have the responsibility to flag papers that may need an in-depth ethics review (which will be performed by an ethics reviewer). The rest of this section provides guidelines for flagging papers for ethics review. More precisely, we list bad practices in ethics flagging, that result in false flags. Over-flagging should be avoided as it burdens the review process by overloading ethics reviewers.</p>"},{"location":"resources/ethical-review-recommendations/#what-to-avoid","title":"What to avoid?","text":"<ol> <li>No justification: If you are flagging a paper for full ethics review, please try to give a clear and succinct justification so that ethics chairs can appropriately assign ethics reviewers for the paper. A huge majority of papers still get flagged without the justification field being filled in, or left as \u201cN/A\u201d, \u201cNone\u201d, \u201cNo ethical concerns\u201d etc. This unnecessarily adds to the workload of the ethics chairs and reviewers.</li> <li>Flagging for Missing Section(s): Another substantial number of papers get incorrectly flagged because of missing ethical considerations section, or missing limitations section, or incompletely/incorrectly filled Responsible AI checklist. While these issues may need to be flagged to the AE\u2019s attention, and in some cases may justify desk rejection (in case of Limitations section for certain conferences), they do not justify a full ethics review. For ACL conferences, these issues can be flagged in the \"reviewer checklist\". Similarly, adding an ethical considerations section is not mandatory; however if you believe there are specific ethical issues that warrant a full review, please flag the paper and provide a clear justification.</li> <li>Flagging for Copyright, Consent, Transparency: While it is important to ensure that ARR process correctly flags submissions that may be in violation of copyright policies of datasets used, inadequate informed consent process, or transparency of presented artifacts, these issues in and of themselves do not justify a fuller ethics review. Instead, since you have already identified the issue, you can call out the authors in your review or meta review itself to address these issues. However, if there are aspects that require a deeper look, you can of course flag it for a full ethics review, outlining the concern.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"resources/ethical-review-recommendations/#common-misconceptions","title":"Common Misconceptions","text":"<ol> <li>All Data-centric Papers require Ethics Review: A common misstep is assuming that any paper discussing data usage needs a full ethics review. This is **not** the case. Instead, focus should be on potential misuse or unethical handling of data. A mere description of data usage does not automatically warrant an in-depth review.</li> <li>Use of Human Annotators require Ethics Review: The involvement of human annotators in a study does **not** on its own justify an ethics review. However, if there are specific concerns about the human annotation step, such as potential exploitation or ethical lapses, these may warrant an in-depth ethics review.</li> <li>All Datasets on Sensitive Topics require Ethics Review: Datasets that feature critical content, such as misinformation detection, might raise eyebrows due to their potential dual use. But again, the mere presence of such content does not automatically demand a full ethics review. If it involves engaging with specific marginalized communities (e.g., linguistic minorities) or if the content of the annotation involves potentially traumatizing data (e.g., involving hate speech or other gory concepts), then it may justify an in-depth ethics review to assess whether adequate safeguards were taken. In such cases, explain your reasons as justification while flagging for ethics review.</li> <li>All Papers on High-stakes Domains require Ethics Review: While all of NLP research can arguably have downstream human impact, data/methodological innovations on high-stakes domains may have an immediate impact on users or communities. These include educational use cases such as automated grading scenarios, or medical use cases such as in psychotherapy, or legal use cases such as criminality prediction. These may also include challenges in de-identification in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. However, just because a paper focuses on such a high-stakes domain doesn\u2019t by default necessitate a full ethics review. What matters is the context and application of the research. If regulations have been followed and necessary precautions taken, and these are detailed in the paper, then sensitive research areas can be explored without automatically qualifying for a full ethics review.</li> <li>All Papers on NLP ethics require Ethics Review: A paper engaging with questions on NLP ethics and fairness in and of itself does not justify an in-depth ethics review. However, many of these papers do tend to engage with topics that are potentially sensitive and may sometimes need an in-depth review. But this determination should be based on such additional contexts, rather than merely for the topic being NLP ethics.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"resources/ethical-review-recommendations/#checklist-for-responsible-nlp-research","title":"Checklist for Responsible NLP Research","text":"<p>Most questions in this (checklist) address the kinds of information that is often asked by reviewers (e.g. experimental details, annotation protocols, IRB approval, etc.). For every submission, it checks whether the authors describe the limitations and potential risks of the work.

Moreover, it checks for documentation and statistics description of the artifacts. When computational experiments are conducted, it checks if the authors report the number of parameters in the models used, the total computational budget (e.g., GPU hours), and computing infrastructure used, discuss the experimental setup, including hyperparameter search and best-found hyperparameter values, report descriptive statistics about the results, and use any existing packages. For work involving human participants, it checks whether the authors report the full text of instructions given to participants, report information about how you recruited (e.g., crowdsourcing platform, students) and paid participants, discuss if such payment is adequate, discuss whether and how consent was obtained, get approval or exempt for the data collection protocol from an ethics review board, as well as report the basic demographic and geographic characteristics of the annotator population that is the source of the data.

As part of this process, the committee chairs and Luciana Benotti (a member of the committee) put together a the proposal file and submitted it to the joint call for tutorial proposals.</p> <p>The tutorial was eventually accepted to run at EACL 2023 (Dubrovnik, Croatia, 2-6 May 2023) on Saturday, 6 May as part of the \u00bd-day AM events.  We produced a teaser to accompany the published tutorial abstract.</p> <p>The tutorial and its materials* were presented in English.  It was structured as per the proposal, in seven segments, each approximately 30 minutes long.  It was participatory in nature, requiring the audience to work in groups on synthetic problematic abstracts written by the proposers that represent common ethical issues experienced by ethics review chairs.  This required a good facilitator-to-group ratio, to ensure all of the participants had a chance to reflect, contribute and be heard, and for the facilitators to keep the session on track.</p> <p>*<sub>(Due to the sensitive nature of our EACL 2023 participants' contribution, we have scrubbed the QR coded and shortlinked materials of their presence; if any party wants to access the original document we have these archived but not in this repository nor linked to here; please contact us directly)</sub></p> Segment Topic Led By 1.

This segment was presented by Yulia Tsvetkov.</p> <p>Segment 7A (Slides 86-99) reprised work from Benotti and Blackburn (2022) Ethical Consideration Sections in Natural Language Processing Papers, which examined such written ECS in NLP papers to analyze the issues covered in terms of 1) research benefits, 2) potential harms, and 3) vulnerable groups affected.  It covers the differences between geographical region's reporting of such issues.
